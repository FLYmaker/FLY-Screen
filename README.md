# FLY-Screen
Marlin firmware, you only need to set the baud rate to 115200 to communicate with the screen\r\n
Duet reprap firmware: If you have turned on "Enable support for PanelDue", you need to modify the sys/config.g file M575 P1 S1 B57600 to M575 P1 S0 B57600
If you donâ€™t enable it, just add M575 P1 S0 B57600 to sys/config.g
